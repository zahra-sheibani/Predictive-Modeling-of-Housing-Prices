# Predictive-Modeling-of-Housing-Prices
Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices based on physical and locational features such as area, number of rooms, year built, and material quality.\
*The workflow included comprehensive data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features via one-hot encoding), feature standardization, and model training using the GradientBoostingRegressor.\
*To ensure consistency between training and test sets, missing value imputation and encoding strategies were aligned, and feature columns were synchronized.\
*Dimensionality reduction via PCA was evaluated but discarded due to its negative impact on model performance.\
*Model performance was evaluated using RMSE and 5-fold cross-validation, with results compared against a provided benchmark submission.\
*Final predictions were validated against ground truth values in the test set, demonstrating high predictive accuracy.
